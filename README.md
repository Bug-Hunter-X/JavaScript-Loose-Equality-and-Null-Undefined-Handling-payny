# JavaScript Loose Equality and Null/Undefined Handling

This repository demonstrates a common error in JavaScript: using loose equality (==) to check for null or undefined values.  Loose equality performs type coercion, which can lead to unexpected results when comparing with null or undefined.

## Bug Description

The `foo` function uses loose equality (`==`) to check if parameters `a` and `b` are null or undefined. This can result in incorrect behavior because of type coercion.  For example, `0 == null` evaluates to `false`, even though `0` is a falsy value that might be considered analogous to `null` in certain situations.

## Solution

The solution uses strict equality (`===`) to avoid type coercion and ensure accurate null/undefined checks.
